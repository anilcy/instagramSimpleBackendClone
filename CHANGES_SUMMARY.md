dotnet ef database update
```

### Dependency Injection
Update your `Program.cs` to register the new services and repositories:
```csharp
// Add new repositories
builder.Services.AddScoped<IFollowRepository, FollowRepository>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMessageRepository, MessageRepository>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<INotificationRepository, NotificationRepository>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IUserRepository, UserRepository>();

// Add new services  
builder.Services.AddScoped<IFollowService, FollowService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMessageService, MessageService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<INotificationService, NotificationService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IUserService, UserService>();
```

### AutoMapper Configuration
Update your AutoMapper profiles to include mappings for all the new DTOs.
